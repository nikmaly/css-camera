	Note:

	You'll notice lots of commented out lines in this file.

	This is really meant to just have a small amount of JS sitting behind it.
	I converted it to use React for my portfolio, and clearly this is a vanilla html
	file, so it's not set up to work here.

	I've put in comments where you wanted to be putting things in - I'll leave my
	React version commented out if you want to re-use it.
