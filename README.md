# CssCamera

Not a lot to say about this one, just having fun with a sort-of-material-design pure css camera.
Very early piece of work so it's not actually mobile responsive, and I haven't found a use for it yet so I haven't converted it.

Has a cute piece of 'take a picture' 'functionality' where on clicking the shutter release button, it will flash the flash and open the screen with an image of your choice (and link).

Example implementation: http://nik.malyaris.com/projects/css-camera

# Options

Only real option here is to add in a background image for the 'screen' that pops up when you 'take' a photo with the shutter button.
Set as a background image in the css.
